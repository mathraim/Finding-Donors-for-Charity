    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer:\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "  - Some of applications of Decision Trees can be classifing data into different categories. It is good for recommending an app to a new user based on preferences of other users. \n",
    "  - Strength of this model that it handles categorical feature better that any other algoritms because all other are more focused on numerical features. Trees are focus on enthropy a nd information gain of the features, so there is not really a big difference between numerical and categorical features for the tree classifier. Also it can be very accurate algorithm with a very high accuracy on the trainings set\n",
    "  - Weakness of the tree classifier is that it is easy to overfit the tree. It is easy to just memorize the data instead of classifing it. If we have too much features the tree would very very big, but even if it would have a veyr good accuracy on the set, It would not generalize well and It would do bad on the new data. Also the depth of the tree is very important becaus if depth also will be very big, the algorithm also would over fit the data  \n",
    "  - Decision Tree is a good candidate for this problem because it has a lot of categorical features, so the Decision Tree with Random Forest would be one of the best solutions for ths problem\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "  - There is a lot of application where SVM can be used for. It can be used everywhere where We need to classify the tha data like spam detection, face detection andd image classification\n",
    "  - Strength of this model that we are not only classifying the data we are finding the best classification because of the maximizing the margin. We are fitting the stripe to the data instead of just a line. We can control overfitiing by changing the parameter C. Also It uses kernels and feature mapping like 'rbf' so we can even fit not linear dataset to our model\n",
    "  - The problem arises when our training set very big for non linear kernels. Here in kernels, we have to find a kernel similarity function between all the points in the dataset and it makes the complexity very big, so when we have too big dataset, the algoritm would take too long to learn\n",
    "  - In this case, SVM is not a really good caandidate for our data because we have a lot of examples - 45222, so it would work really slow\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "  - The application of the random forest can be the same with just decision tree like recommending an app to a new user\n",
    "  - Strength of random forest are almost the same with decision trees, because they are also one of the best algorithms to use if we have a lot of categorical data like relationship and occupation. Also random forests are really good to prevent overfitting of the decision tree algorithm. If we a have too much features the decision tree would overfit the data as it would just remember the data. By taking random small sets of the trees we prevent overfitting if we have too much features\n",
    "  - some of the weaknesses of the random forest can be that it trains several decision trees, and predicts according to several decisions trees, so it several time slower than decision tree to predicts the values becuase here we have to predict a value according all trees created and the answer with the most frequency \n",
    "  - Becuase our dataset also has a lot of categorical data, the random forest also can be a very good candidate for the best model\n",

    "- Svm\n",
    "  - If we look at the performance of the SVM on the dataset, we can clearly see that it takes too long in order to train the model and to predict new values. Also graph shows that it is not really fitting even the training set compared to random forest and decision tree. However, it tends to generalize at the same level with random forest and decision tree. Also accuracy is very good as well as other algorithms. It classified the data set well, but still it is not really the most efficient and best algorith because it takes too much to run SVM compared to others algorithm because while calculating landmarks and feature mapping requires to evaluate a kernel fucktion betweein all point in the data set, so when we have a lot of examples it takes too long to run the code \n",
    "- Random forest\n",
    "  - Random forest have almost the same performace with Decision tree. There is a difference but it very small every where besides time of the predicting the values for testing set. It has a good f score that equals to something near 7, and it slightly bigger that decision tree. Because it combines several decision trees it takes more time to run random forest than a simple dicision tree, but the performance of the two are not really different. Random forest is an acceptable algorithm but still it is not the most efficient.\n",
    "- Decision tree\n",
    "  - Decision tree is the most fastest algorithm amongst these three. Also it is fitted very well to the training set compared to random forest that shows that might be overfit but we can regularize it using grid search later. However, The f score for all of the three algoritm is good and equals to something near to 0.6. It can be slightly less than random forest because it might overfit a little the dataset but it can regulaerized by grid search. Three algorithm have almost the same performance but the most efficient is the decision tree and therefore the best algorithm is the decision tree\n",

    "**Answer: \n",
    "    Decision Tree is a very usefull algorithm for classification problems. It creates a tree of conditions and if we would go over this tree according the conditions with a new example, then at the end we will find the category for this new example. In another words decision tree almost sort of writes a code by itself with a bunch of (if else) statements and then according to the trained conditions evaluates a new example. It trains the contitions by training set. Among all the features for the esamples algorithm finds first decisive algorithm by evaluating the features according to \"information gain\" and \"entropy\". Entropy in a simple words is a measure of how messy the data is. If entopy is high, if we take a new example from the dataset, the probality that this example belongs to the any particular category is low, so we cannot say with a confidence to which category this example belongs. An example, of the set with a high entropy is a box with 2 red balls, and two blue balls. If we take any ball from here it is 50% percent chanse that it is blue and 50% percent that it is red, so If would like to predict the color of this ball we would not do better than justa random choice. If entropy is low, that means that the elements are very predictable. An example of the set like this would be a box with with just 4 red balls. I know that if I take any ball from this box it is going to be 100% red ball because all the balls in the set are red. Information gain is also a very important concept for decision trees. Any condition in the tree splits the data to some sets of the data. information gain is a measure of how good the split was and how much we learn from it about the data set that makes the algorithm better than just taking a random choice. For example, if we would divide a set of 2 red balls and 2 blue balls into 2 sets with a red ball and a blue ball inside. This split does not absolutely any information about the data that would make the algorithm better than a random choice and therefore we can not learn anything from this split. If we would predict a new values according to this split we would just make a random choice. Another example, if we would divide the set with 2 red balls and 2 blue balls accorfing to one condition into two set with 2 red balls in one and 2 blue ball in the another one. This split would give us a lot of information, because if new ball given I can be very confident that i can predict the color of the ball according to the conditions. Information gain is used in order to evaluate the conditions for our tree and it can be calculated by the entopies of the two perspective splits. Information gain is like an opposite of cost fucntion in the another algorithm like logistic regression, so the main goal of the trees is to choose the conditions(in another words splits of data, or if else statement) that maximize the information gainfor the splits\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
